                <p class="col">I was nine years old, standing on a train platform in New Delhi when a girl my age carrying an infant approached me and extended her upturned palm. Before I could respond, a police officer appeared, struck the girl in the legs with a bamboo rod and chased her out of the station, leaving me shocked and confused. What did this girl do to deserve such treatment? Why did I have the right to stand there unharmed? This incident profoundly impacted my worldview at a young age. From that moment, I have been determined to build relationships with people from disadvantaged communities and help create opportunities that allow them to hope for a better future.</p>

              <p class="col">Throughout my youth, I volunteered in various capacities ranging from working in soup kitchens to tutoring children from low-income neighborhoods. As I bonded with the children I tutored and saw them flourish, I came to recognize the power of human connection and the need for mentorship in the lives of young people growing up under trying circumstances. I wanted to further immerse myself in the world of the kids I worked with. This desire led me to my first post-college job, working at an organization in the Dominican Republic for which I volunteered during college.</p>

                <p class="col">I moved to the Dominican Republic to work in a school for children living in abject poverty. However, shortly after my arrival, I was asked to fill the newly-vacant role of full-time caregiver for a group of boys ranging from six to nine years old. Despite the heightened responsibility, caring for these boys is one of the highlights of my life. Each morning at dawn, I enjoyed a cup of coffee in peace before braving the chaos of getting seven rambunctious boys ready for school. In the evenings, we would run through the house with whatever makeshift weapons we could find to chase off the ‘bruja’ - an imaginary witch that flew through their bedroom window at night. No period of my life has been so physically and emotionally demanding, yet rarely have I experienced such joy. Fostering positive growth in the lives of these boys required that I develop a nuanced understanding of the circumstances surrounding their childhood. This understanding continues to impact the way I see the world around me.</p>

              <div class="row">
               <p class="col">I was surprised by the nearly ubiquitous presence of technology in the poverty-stricken town where I lived in the Dominican Republic. People lived in tiny, dirt-floor homes, yet managed to pay for smartphones. Fascinated with the impact of technology on my new surroundings, I decided to learn to write code. Much of my free time in the Dominican Republic was spent building clones of popular web applications, including some of the social media sites that compel many of my Dominican friends to own a smartphone. I am grateful that technology allows me to keep in touch with my friends in the Dominican Republic, yet I am conflicted knowing that jobs in the tech industry have yet to reach their community and help counterbalance this new expense in their lives.</p>

              <div class="row">
                <p>In August of 2014, my father-in-law was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I made the difficult decision to leave the Dominican Republic, as my wife and I were engaged at the time and wanted to do whatever we could to ensure he would be there to walk her down the aisle. I left the boys in the qualified hands of a local Dominican woman who replaced me, yet the same confusion I felt at the train station in India permeates my thoughts and memories of the Dominican Republic. I fear that lack of opportunity will cause the boys I lived with to fall victim to the endemic poverty surrounding them.</p>

                <p>Upon my return to the United States, I started to work on freelance web development projects while taking classes to further my skills as a developer. Shortly thereafter, I decided to start my own business, primarily working with startups on existing products and collaborating with successful business owners to optimize antiquated systems used by their companies. My passion for connecting with people allowed me to quickly establish a substantial client base. Additionally, creating my own schedule allowed me to prioritize time with my father-in-law in his final months and care for my wife as we grieved his passing.</p>

I am fortunate to have realized many of the goals I set out to accomplish, and as I look forward to the next phase of my career, I am compelled to share the economic opportunities enabling my success with disadvantaged communities. My dream is to help individuals living in poverty develop the necessary skills for successful careers and facilitate connections between these individuals and employers. In turn, I hope these new jobs will alleviate some of the social issues plaguing impoverished communities and provide a brighter future for children like the boys I lived with.</p>

My experiences working in both impoverished communities and the flourishing technology industry have inspired me to confront this disparity through culturally tailored technical training and subsequent employment opportunities. The innovative curriculum at Cornell Tech would place me at the cutting edge of the intersection between technology and business, allowing me to hone the skills I will need to accomplish this dream.</p>

I’m eager, however, to expand and strengthen my capacity to build groundbreaking products that will help transform society. The opportunity to work with individuals across multiple disciplines to develop and refine ideas in Product Studio would provide me with invaluable experience in light of my long term goals. Furthermore, the Startup Studio Project would give me incredible insight into the framework needed to turn an abstract idea into a successful business. I’m particularly excited about the iTrek course, as learning to successfully engage the digital economy in a cross-cultural context will play a crucial role in the work I hope to undertake. Applying new concepts in real-world situations while receiving feedback from professors and peers would be instrumental in developing the wisdom and prowess I need to successfully combat complex social issues.</p>
